```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Should you do a linear regression on this data? Explain.

```{r}
Y <- c(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
X <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)

plot(X,Y)

```

Based on the data provided, I would have to conclude a linear regression would not be optimal for this data. This data is presented as a “V” shape, meaning it is not linear. The correlation for this data would be equal to zero considering there is no linear relationship to this data. There is a relationship between X and Y, though it is in  the shape of a “V”. This would lead to the conclusion that there is no relationship between the data if a linear regression were performed because the data is not linear. For these reasons a linear regression should not be performed on this data set. 


Confidence: 95
